Bullet Points on Your Resume: Will They Make Me Look Lazy?
Bullet points should absolutely be used on your resume, and will not make you look lazy. Instead, they will help draw recruiters or hiring managersâ€™ attention to important points while allowing them to read through your resume faster.

Bullet points are a great way to create white space and break up information into shorter, easier-to-read points. They can help make your resume format cleaner and more easily accessible to the reader, but like paragraphs, they should not be overused. Instead, they should be used in conjunction with paragraphs to offer more information about your skills and experience.
